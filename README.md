# PreprocessingForML
Preprocessing programs I use to prep data for machine learning.
This is for various programs I use to preprocess medical images for Machine Learning.  I use a variety of languages, including Mathematica, MatLab, and python 3.7.
Intial program is written in Mathematica.  It attempts to unscramble images I found in downloaded images for CheXpert challenge.  Out of the approximately 230,000 images I downloaded, there were slightly over 200 that appeared to be mangled by a computer algorithm.  Basically, rows of the image were shifted right or left to distort the image.  The program I have written attempts to shift those altered rows back into correct position.  It is not always successful.  The program is Rectifylistimagetest.nb.  I don't supply the large datafiles (train.csv,test.csv, valid.csv, or the .jpg images).  I list the bad files I found by a cursory review of the 223000 images.  The program uses parameters encoded in the script, so you will have to edit the script to use it.  I only include a few examples because of the sized of the saved script.
